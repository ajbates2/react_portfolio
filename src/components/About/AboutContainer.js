                I am currently a student in the Full Stack Software Engineering program with
                 Thinkful. I am excited to continue learning and sharpening my skills as a web
                  developer and problem solver. I love problem solving and the constant
                   challenges that are brought with learning JavaScript and all of the related
                    tech.<br /><br /> Having worked in a restaurant and in the service industry for
                     essentially my whole life, I work great in a team, and  especially
                      great in high stress situations. I can't wait to work with a great team
                       of programmers and developers to apply my knowledge to a different
                        challenge everyday.

                My love for technology is what ultimately pushed me to get into web development.
                 I enjoy video games (built multiple PC's), movies, and music. When I'm not
                  coding you might find me bartending (I love beer), or going to see some live
                   music. Just like every other millennial I collect vinyl and shoes.
