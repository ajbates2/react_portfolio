        bio: `The pandemic broght on a lot hurdles to overcome in the service industry. One big issue was state mandated reservations for all restaurants. I saw this as a great opportunity to create a user experience we haven't taken advantage of at the bar we worked at. Not only was this a way to contact people for there reservations, it also makes it easier for us to contact people if there was an outbreak.`,
